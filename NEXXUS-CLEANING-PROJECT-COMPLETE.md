2. **Login Page Integration**: Demo mode buttons added to login pages for each role
3. **Mock User Data**: Realistic user profiles and data for each role
4. **Professional UI**: Enterprise-level styling suitable for client presentations
5. **Zero Setup Required**: No database configuration or authentication needed

### **How It Works**

#### **Method 1: Direct Dashboard Access**
```
/admin-dashboard     → Shows "Enter Portal" button → Full admin dashboard
/cleaner-dashboard   → Shows "Enter Portal" button → Full cleaner dashboard  
/homeowner-dashboard → Shows "Enter Portal" button → Full homeowner dashboard
```

#### **Method 2: Login Page Demo Mode**
```
/login?role=admin     → Shows login form + "🚀 Enter Admin Portal" button
/login?role=cleaner   → Shows login form + "🚀 Enter Cleaner Portal" button
/login?role=homeowner → Shows login form + "🚀 Enter Homeowner Portal" button
```

### **Mock User Data**
Each role gets appropriate mock data:

```typescript
